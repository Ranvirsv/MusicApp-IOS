# Music App (iOS)

## Description
This is a music player application developed for the C323 final project. The music player app offers a seamless and intuitive user experience through its three primary views: Home, Search, and Library. It provides features such as browsing and playing stored songs, dynamic search functionality, and managing user-generated playlists.

## Features
- **Home View:** Allows users to navigate through their stored songs and select any one of them to begin playback.
- **Search View:** Provides a powerful search functionality to search through the entire music library, including stored songs and playlists.
- **Library View:** Offers a comprehensive overview of the user's music collection, listing user-generated playlists and imported albums.

## Technologies Used
- **Core Data:** Used to store the user's music library data, including artist, album, and track information, as well as user-generated playlists.
- **User Notifications:** Displays notifications to the user during playback, such as when a new track starts playing or when user interaction is required.
- **Media Player:** Provides core audio playback functionality, including play, pause, skip, and rewind options, as well as fetching and displaying metadata about the currently playing track.

## Getting Started
To run the Music App project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Xcode version 14 or later installed.
2. Clone the reop and open the project in Xcode.
3. Configure the iOS Simulator or connect your testing hardware, works best with iPhone SE.
4. Build and run the app on the simulator or your device.

## Usage
Upon launching the app, users will be taken to the song list screen. From there:
- Tap on a song to play it.
- Tap on the heart icon next to a song title to mark it as a favorite.
- Access the favorites screen by tapping on the "Favorites" tab at the bottom to view all marked favorite songs.

## Development Details (Final Doc)
The MusicApp project was developed using Xcode version 14. It includes various features and functionalities, including playing songs, marking favorites, and displaying album covers. The app has a polished user interface with a tab view controller and navigation controller. The home and search views allow users to browse and search for songs.

### Changes Made from Original Design
- The library view was not implemented as initially planned.
- Playlists and external media controller features were not included due to technical limitations. Could be updated with newer version

## Testing
The MusicApp was primarily tested using the iOS Simulator provided by Xcode, with the iPhone 13 Pro Max device selected. The app was compiled with default compile settings in Xcode.
